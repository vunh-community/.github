# NVIDIA Dynamo

[Dynamo](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo) is a new modular inference framework designed for serving large language models (LLMs) in multi-node distributed environments. It enables seamless scaling of inference workloads across GPU nodes and the dynamic allocation of GPU workers to address traffic bottlenecks at various stages of the model pipeline.

This GitHub organization hosts repositories for Dynamo's core components and integrations, including:

**[Core Framework](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/lib/runtime)**

- Distributed inference runtime with Rust-based orchestration
- Python bindings for workflow customization
- Multi-GPU/multi-node serving capabilities

**[LLM Optimized Components](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/dynamo/tree/main/lib/llm)**

- Disaggregated Serving Engine: Decoupling of prefill and decode to optimize for throughput at latency SLOs
- Intelligent Routing System: Prefix-based and load-aware request distribution
- KV Cache Management: Distributed KV Cache management

**[NVIDIA Optimized Transfer Library (NIXL)](https://github.com/ai-dynamo/nixl)**

- Abstracts memory of heterogeneous devices, i.e., CPU, GPU, storage, and enables most efficient and low-latency communication among them
- Integrates with distributed inference servers such as Dynamo. This library will target distributed inference communication patterns to effectively transfer the KV cache in disaggregated LLM serving platforms.
